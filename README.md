# EM sample
Simple expectation-maximization implementation for gaussian mixture models


### Resources used:

For understanding the theory, and why the E and M terms are exactly what they are:

Help for calculating the M-step parameter formulas:

For knowing which are the unobserved variables (imaginary facepalm to myself for not seing that right away):
